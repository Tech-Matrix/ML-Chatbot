# ChatBotMLproject
# *Chatbot_main.py is the final completed version of the code*
# Developed using Python (chatbot code) and java (dataset)
# You'll need to install ALOT of libraries - tensorflow, pickle, json, numpy .... so be careful about that 
# If you have issues installing it using the normal "pip install 'module' " command , then try using "python -m pip install --upgrade 'module' "
# 2 datasets have been uploaded - a) related to PESU academy b)related to Newolf Society, you can create your own dataset based on the type of service your chatbot is providing

# You could even use java or html for the front end ,we've made it using python's gui framework
# Try using lemmatisation instead od stemming , try different types of stemmers and training models to figure out which one works the best 
# If your chatbot's accuracy is around 0.9something it's good to go , if you get more than 1 or less than 0.8something then you'll need to try increasinging the accuracy by adding more intents (this is the easiest way tho)
# It may seem hard in the beginning but it's not once you unerstand what's actually going on :)
# Also we could'nt upload the entire video of it working , so we uploaded just a small clip of it
